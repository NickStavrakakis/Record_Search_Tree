# Record Search Tree

## _Academic Year of 2018-2019_

This project is about performing queries in a high-level binary file and the classification of search results. The processes of the binary process tree implement the search for records in the file and the nodes-leaves undertake to search for records in parts of the file, while internal nodes compose the results they get from children and promote them to their parents. The final classification of the results is done by the system call sort(), after the finish of the search process.
